# Multi-source-RS-DGConv

## Description

Implementation of the paper "Single-stream CNN with Learnable Architecture for Multi-source Remote Sensing Data". (under review)

[[arxiv]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06094)

## Usage
- Requirements: python3, pytorch, gdal, sklearn. 
- Simply run 
```
python3 main.py
```
- To customize training/model arguments, modify ```common.py```. Arguments are automatically loaded to ```main.py```.

## Data
We made some modifications (merely tifâ†’numpy, stacking) to the original data files. Our data files are available at [this Google Drive site](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1urY6Pjba3mStDcRphIfkNf50295aW2o2?usp=sharing), which can be directly used in this code. Please note that we used channel-wise normalization AFTER loading these files, and this step is already implemented in our code.
