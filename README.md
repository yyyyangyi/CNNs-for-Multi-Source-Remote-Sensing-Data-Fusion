# CNNs for Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data Fusion

## Description

Pytorch implementation of the paper "Single-stream CNN with Learnable Architecture for Multi-source Remote Sensing Data". 

Multi-stream CNNs are commonly used in multi-source remote sensing data fusion. In this work we propose an efficient strategy that enables single-stream CNNs to approximate multi-stream models using group convolution. The proposed method is applied to ResNet and UNet, and evaluated on Houston2018, Berlin, MUUFL data sets, obtaining promising results. An interesting finding is that _regularization_ is playing an important role in these models.

## Usage
- Requirements: python3, pytorch, gdal, sklearn. 
- Simply run 
```
python3 main.py
```
- To customize training/model arguments, modify ```common.py```. Arguments are automatically loaded to ```main.py```.

## Baseline models

This repository also contains Pytorch implementation of the following models, which we use as baselines: 

- _Fusion-FCN_: A three-branch CNN for MS-HSI-LiDAR data fusion. Award-winning model in 2018 IEEE DFC. 
[[Paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8518295/): "Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data Classification via Fully Convolutional Networks and Post-Classification Processing"

- _Two-branch CNN_ (_TB-CNN_): A two-branch CNN architecture for feasture fusion with HSI and other remote scensing imagery. [[Paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8068943): "Multisource Remote Sensing Data Classification Based on Convolutional Neural Network" [[Official Tensorflow implementation]](https://github.com/Hsuxu/Two-branch-CNN-Multisource-RS-classification)

Implementation of these models can be found at ```model/baseline/```. 

## Data
We made some modifications (merely tifâ†’numpy, stacking) to the original data files. Our data files are available at [this Google Drive site](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1urY6Pjba3mStDcRphIfkNf50295aW2o2?usp=sharing), which can be directly used in this code. Please note that we used channel-wise normalization AFTER loading these files, and this step is already implemented in our code.
